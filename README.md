# Hand-Drawn-Number

This project aims to classify unknown images of hand-written number (either 2 or 6) using 3 supervised machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Neural Network. Labels 1 and 0 denote 6 and 2, repectively. 

The Handrawn_data.csv file contains a total of 784 image data, each having 1990 pixels. The code separtees the data into 80 percent training and 20 percent testing. This ratio can be adjusted by chaning the "test_size" parameter in line 13 of the code.

Resulted example images are also attached along with confusion matrices for each algorithm.
