# Hand-Drawn-Number

This project aims to classify unknown images of hand-written number (either 2 or 6) using 3 supervised machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Neural Network. Labels 1 and 0 denote 6 and 2, repectively. 

Resulted example images are also attached along with confusion matrices for each algorithm.
